# OSP ResultCodes aoresult

Library "OSP ResultCodes aoresult", usually abbreviated to "aoresult",
is one of the **aolibs**; short for Arduino OSP libraries from ams-OSRAM.
This suite implements support for chips that use the Open System Protocol, 
like the AS1163 ("SAID") or the OSIRE E3731i ("RGBi").
The landing page for the _aolibs_ is on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/ams-OSRAM/OSP_aotop).


## Introduction

Library _aoresult_ is at the base of the dependency graph.
It contains (defines) a list of all error codes that
may occur in any of the _aolibs_.
As a result, library _aoresult_ is relatively empty.

The error codes could have been integrated in the next library 
in the hierarchy (_aospi_), and _aoresult_ would be superfluous. 
However, _aospi_ likely needs variants (supporting other MCUs, 
1-wire SPI, dropping mux support) so splitting off the error codes 
in a separate library _aoresult_ makes sense.


## Examples

This library comes with the following examples.
You can find them in the Arduino IDE via 
File > Examples > OSP ResultCodes aoresult > ...

- **aoresult_demo** ([source](examples/aoresult_demo))  
  This demo shows how to convert the result codes from the aoresult lib
  to strings.

- **aoresult_assert** ([source](examples/aoresult_assert))  
  This demo shows how to use the assert feature of the aoresult library.
  Patch the definition of `AORESULT_ASSERT` if a debugger is attached.


## API

The header [aoresult.h](src/aoresult.h) contains the API of this library.
The header contains little documentation; for that see the
[aoresult.cpp](src/aoresult.cpp) source file. 

Here is a quick overview:

- `aoresult_t` the global list of error codes in the _aolibs_ (enumeration data type).

- `aoresult_to_str(result)` converts an error code to a (short) string or a (longer) description.

- `AORESULT_ASSERT(cond)` Checks if `cond` holds, if not, prints error to `Serial`, and stops.
   Uses helper function `aoresult_shorten(filename)`.

- Finally, there is the macro `AORESULT_VERSION`, which identifies the version of the library.
